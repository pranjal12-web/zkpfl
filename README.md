# zkPFL 

**A revolutionary way to train Deep Learning AI Models through Proof of Stake & ZK Proofs!**

# Introduction

zkPFL stands for Zero Knowledfe based Differentially Private Federated learning. It is a unique way to train DL models utilising blockchain, decentralised computing & Zero-Knowledge proofs for enhanced security & faster computations based on trustlessness & ultra-privacy.

# How it Works
 
It is a **dual-side** platform where both a general user who wants their model to be trained and a client who will train the deep learning models uploaded by various users at their end using their own private datasets. 
**Foundation:** The foundation of this idea is this research paper on [Zero-Knowledge based Federated Learning](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/zkfl-zero-knowledge-proof-based-gradient)
